                My Porpouse
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>to explore and expand boundaries through efficient and high-performance algorithms </li>
                <li>to invent, hybridize and build </li>
                <li>to serve the larger community through writing and teaching of broad intellectual subject matter
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I'd like to give you a different type of description of who I am, to put my accomplishments into a
                3-dimensional picture. You'll get to know me better this way.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I tenaciously pursue long-term projects: I began my reaction-diffusion project in 1994, kept coming
                    back to it as computers improved, until in 2009 I discovered exotic patterns worth publishing. I
                    gave a talk on this to Rutgers' mathematics department in 2010; my work on this continues </li>
                <li>I have an all-consuming passion for numbers, and very large numbers. I seek ways to explore their
                    beauty and mystery, and evangelize them to others. Much of my website is devoted to this, and
                    software projects have come out of this: my RIES program (which resulted in my mention in xkcd)
                    finds formulas/equations in one variable given its root (solution), with results ranked both by
                    closeness of match and increasing formula complexity. Within a week of the xkcd mention I created
                    PHP/SQL backend so people would use RIES on their phones. Another example of my exploration of
                    numbers is my mcsfind program, which is like RIES for integer sequences </li>
                <li>I've worked with amazing people. Neil Sloane is a world-renowned applied mathematician; I began
                    corresponding with him about 25 years ago, and my contributions to his books and to OEIS (the Online
                    Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, a database highly used by mathematicians) led to my becoming a
                    board member of OEIS </li>
                <li>I am an inventor and engineer. I made the Hypercalc large-numbers calculator for PalmOS in 1994 and
                    eventually translated it into Perl. After seeing Blue Man Group I designed and built my own version
                    of their PVC organ. I have created several partial and complete orrery designs from LEGO, an example
                    of constrained design </li>
                <li>I love building and analyzing puzzles. I love Rubik's Cube type puzzles, built a couple of my own,
                    and wrote software to find algorithms for their solution. Based on "2048" I created Q04B, my idea
                    for a much more beautiful and engaging game with an elegant user interface </li>
                <li>I love the community of creative, passionate and like-minded artists and scientists. My recent "home
                    online" has been a forum thread for xkcd, where I have posted original works: comics, stories,
                    poetry, recorded songs, software and hybrid works </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Recent Projects</h3>
    <ul class="o">
        <li>Q04B (greatly enhanced 2048-like game; HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript with ApplicationCache, created in 2014). </li>
        <li>RIES (inverse equation-solver; mentioned in xkcd in 2012; standalone C and server with backend in PHP/SQL)
        </li>
        <li>PDE4 reaction-diffusion simulator, website to exhibit results; screensaver; I published a paper and gave a
            talk to Rutgers' mathematical physics department in 2010. </li>
        <li>Sloandora, a system for user-guided discovery in the OEIS integer sequences database, 2009. </li>
        <li>The MCS project, including the mcsfind program, finds the simplest formula matching a given set of small
            integers. </li>
        <li>My own web pages are created in RHTF, a markup language of my own design that is "embarassingly readable"
            and more powerful than alternatives such as Markdown, Wikitext, BoostBook, etc.</li>
