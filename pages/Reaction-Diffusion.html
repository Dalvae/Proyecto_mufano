        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Instructions: A click anywhere in the crescent-shaped complex region will take you to a page with images, a
            movie and a specific description. Each grid square leads to a different page. </p>
        <p>You may prefer to browse the different patterns by starting with my extension of Pearson's classification of
            the types of emergent behaviours. I also have special pages for the U-skate world and certain other very
            exotic patterns, and a Gray-Scott nomenclature glossary.</p>

                    What Is It?
                </p>
                <p>All of the images and animations were created by a computer calculation using the formula (two
                    equations)
                    shown below. In Roy Williams' words, it is a "relatively simple parabolic partial differential
                    equation".
                    Details are below; the essence of it is that it simulates the interaction of two chemicals that
                    diffuse,
                    react, and are replenished at specific rates given by some numerical quantities. By varying these
                    numerical
                    quantities we obtain many different patterns and types of behavior. </p>
                <span>Insight Into Biology</span>
                <p>The patterns created by this equation, and other very similar equations, seem to closely resemble
                    many
                    patterns seen in living things. Such connections have been suggested by: </p>

                <p> In his original 1994 exhibit3, Roy Williams presented grayscale images for many pairs of k and F,
                    each
                    showing a "histogram-equalised view of the U component". He suggested that the images, after
                    modification by "a little playing with the colour map" would be "quite attractive as gift-wrapping".
                    My
                    images, like Williams', meet their own edges seamlessly, so they would look good if you used them as
                    wallpaper on your computer monitor, for example.

                    The organic appearance and great diversity of patterns makes Gray-Scott patterns ideal for purely
                    artistic applications, such as my own screen saver. </p>
